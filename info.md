##### This Project & Credits
This is a tool/guide to help with negotiations in Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal.

The Royal section takes the negotiation information from Persona 5, so there can be discrepancies between the versions. If you want to help, contribute, or report mistakes, please use the <a href="https://github.com/joyce-chen/persona5-negotiation/issues/16">open issue on Github for P5 Royal</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/joyce-chen/persona5-negotiation/issues/17">open issue for P5</a>, or the <a href="https://forms.gle/JtH9YUekRKVEkYgc6">Google Form</a>. Submitted questions are up-to-date as of **June 11th**.

Thank you to GooberSD/Chompobar for giving me permission to use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fq00lkODNAam7RZoczHU2kFyU3CZvyW59F0PwLnJoz8/">their guide</a> to update this guide.

##### Addressing Feedback

6/5: Who is the Persona with the Shadow name "General of Hell" from the original game? Is it Nebiros?

5/3: The Shadows between the two versions have enough difference that the tables were getting crowded. As per your suggestion, I've split the data over two pages.

4/26: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRI3ZTaHf4RlNuTgYJysCVWzX1e58rB6WoMhPq5gGjlzJZ1A/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.497268018=Persona+5+Royal">Here is a link to the form with "Persona 5 Royal" pre-selected</a>. Google Forms doesn't allow default answers. Other edits were incorportated. The selection for the different wording and reaction is generalized; the reactions can either be a correction or addition.

##### Shadows
The Shadows will initially have a title or description, but once you've captured it, its Persona name will be revealed. A list of the Shadows you'll encounter by area can be viewed on the <a href="shadows">P5 SHADOWS page</a>. The Royal version can be viewed on the <a href="shadows_royal">ROYAL SHADOWS page</a>.

##### Hold Up and Talk
If all enemies in the battle are knocked down, by being hit with attacks they are weak to, a "Hold Up" is triggered. If you choose to "Talk" and say "Lend me your power", you can start negotiating with a Shadow. (If the Shadow is a higher level than Joker, you'll get an item instead.)

##### Personalities
Negotiations are dependent on the Shadow's personality. There are four types of personality: **Gloomy**, **Irritable**, **Timid**, and **Upbeat**. Most other guides feature the following table to help with negotiations, but sometimes it's difficult to distinquish which answers are "vague", "serious", "kind", or "funny".

| Type      |  Likes  | Dislikes        |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Gloomy    | Vague   | Serious, Funny  |
| Irritable | Serious | Vague, Kind     |
| Timid     | Kind    | Vague, Funny    |
| Upbeat    | Funny   | Serious, Vague  |

##### Responses
During negotiations, a Shadow will ask you two questions. For each, you're given three responses to chopse from. Depending on which answer you choose, the Shadow will react in the following ways:

- **Good:** Marked by golden musical notes ðŸŽ¶. This is always the best answer. If you get this for the second question, you will obtain the Shadow as a new Persona.

- **OK:** Marked by light blue sweat marks ðŸ’¦. When you answer the second question with the OK option, you will most likely end the negotiation with an item as a reward. The Persona will then flee after giving the item. However, there is a very small chance, that the Shadow will join you with an OK answer.

- **Bad:** Marked by red angry vein marks ðŸ’¢. It is okay to get a bad answer for the first question. However, if you get a bad answer for the second question you will fail the negotiation and the monster will either run away or youâ€™ll have to fight it again. Once you have a party member hit around level 3 - 4 as a confidant, your characters will be able to potentially step in and save a negotiation should things go south. This ability will usually give you a second chance at negotiating with the Shadow.
